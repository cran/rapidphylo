#' Allele frequencies from 31,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms
#'
#' The dataset “Human_Allele_Frequencies” is a 5 × 31,000 matrix
#' that contains allele frequencies from 31,000 single nucleotide
#' polymorphisms in Chromosomes 1-10 in 5 human populations.
#' The last population “San” is intended to be used as an outgroup.
#' The allele frequencies have been compiled from ALFRED database
#' at Yale University. The analysis from this dataset has been
#' published in Peng et al 2021.
